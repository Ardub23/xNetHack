## xNetHack

xNetHack is a fork of the dungeon exploration game NetHack. It is a distant
descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendant of NetHack 3.6. For more
information on NetHack, visit http://nethack.org, and for its public Git
repository, see https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack.

The purpose of xNetHack is experimentation: to apply one or several new
features, improvements, or balance tweaks to vanilla NetHack at a time, so
their benefits and drawbacks can be examined without piling on other changes,
as all current variants do. Once a change has been tested enough, the
differences from vanilla will be saved as a patch and the rest of the code will
be reset to vanilla 3.6 so a new change can be put forth for testing.
