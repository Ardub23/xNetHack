xNetHack 5.1 Changelog

This is a minor version of xNetHack. It is based directly on xNetHack 5.0, and
consists largely of a merge of the upcoming NetHack 3.7 development code onto
xNetHack.  See doc/fixes37.0 for the devteam's changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, the wiki page might be out of date; in case of
conflicting information, this changelog and others in this directory are more
up-to-date than the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than
this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.7, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 5.1 contains the following
gameplay changes:
