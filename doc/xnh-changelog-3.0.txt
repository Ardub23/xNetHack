xNetHack 3.0 Changelog

This is the first minor update version of xNetHack. It is a fork off of
the vanilla NetHack 3.6.1 release, and is also based directly on
xNetHack 2.0. It will continue to contain all of the latest commits
pushed by the vanilla devteam; see doc/fixes36.1 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, it might be out of date; in case of conflicting
information, this changelog and others in this folder are more up-to-date than
the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.6.1, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 3.0 contains the following
gameplay changes:

Zruties are removed.
A fair amount of monster letter rearrangement:
  All types of sea monsters are moved from ; to z. No colors are changed.
  The U class is rebranded as "aberrations" (and umber hulks remain in it).
  Quantum mechanics are moved from Q to U, and remain cyan.
  Mind flayers and master mind flayers are moved from h to U. They are
    recolored from their cyan/bright cyan to magenta/bright magenta.
  All types of elves are moved from @ to Q (for Quendi). No colors are changed.
Mind flayers and master mind flayers can no longer generate in the Mines on
  account of no longer being h class.
Elves (except the ungenocidable "elf" monster) can now be genocided as a class
  by non-elf players without killing themselves, on account of no longer being
  @ class.
Two new variants of the Oracle level are added.
Add grass terrain, which renders as a green , (comma). Special effects:
  * Concealing monsters can hide in and move through grass while concealed.
  * Fire rays and explosions scorch it, turning it into normal floor.
Replace the Monastery of Chan-Sune (the Monk home level) entirely, as well as
  its flavor text, so that both aren't duplicates of the Priest quest.
Replace the Monastery of the Earth-Lord (the Monk locate level) entirely, as
  well as its flavor text, so that it isn't a duplicate of the Rogue locate
  level.
Replace the Monk upper filler level(s) with a grassy, river-crossed,
  tree-dotted plain instead of room-and-corridor filler.
Replace the Ranger home level with Khor's design for that level, with a couple
  small changes.
Replace the Barbarian upper filler level (empty plain) with a plain that
  contains randomly generated mesas of rock.
Monsters that can hide under objects can also now hide under grass, sinks,
  altars, thrones, graves, and ladders without needing an object there. They
  will also move from concealed spot to concealed spot much faster.

It contains the following non-gameplay interface changes:

If you are not a beginner and would break weaponless conduct for the first
  time, you are prompted to confirm if you really want to.
YAFM if hallucinating and you stumble onto an unseen monster
The livelogging patch is extended to include killing your own pet. This is a
  livelog flag of 0x0100, so anyone using it already should check their sysconf
  to make sure that LIVELOGFLAGS isn't set to 0xFF.

It contains the following non-gameplay architectural changes:
TREEs can now be specified in des files, which obviously produces a tree.
Grass can now be specified in des files (as g or ,), which produces grass.
  Either of these characters can also be used in things like INIT_MAP to create
  a mines-style filler level but with a grassy plain.
Replace has_ceiling(lev) with ceiling_exists() which is implied to mean on the
  current level.
Add a level flag "outdoors", which basically means there is no ceiling.
  Relevant in Quests, and has some particular effects such as scrolls of earth
  not working and rock and rust traps not randomly generating.
Slightly modify syntax of the gradient selection operator in the level
  compiler.
Refactor back_to_defsym to have a third argument, which basically controls
  whether it acts like vanilla or considers xNetHack's visible engravings.
