xNetHack 0.3.0 Changelog

This is the first minor update version of xNetHack. It is a fork off of
the vanilla NetHack 3.6.1 release, and is also based directly on
xNetHack 0.2.0. It will continue to contain all of the latest commits
pushed by the vanilla devteam; see doc/fixes36.1 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, it might be out of date; in case of conflicting
information, this changelog and others in this folder are more up-to-date than
the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.6.1, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 0.3.0 contains the following
gameplay changes:

Zruties are removed.
Mind flayers and master mind flayers can no longer generate in the Mines on
  account of no longer being h class.
Elves (except the ungenocidable "elf" monster) can now be genocided as a class
  by non-elf players without killing themselves, on account of no longer being
  @ class.
Two new variants of the Oracle level are added.
Add grass terrain, which renders as a green , (comma). Currently doesn't do
  anything special.
Replace the Monastery of Chan-Sune (the Monk home level) entirely, as well as
  its flavor text, so that both aren't duplicates of the Priest quest.
Replace the Monastery of the Earth-Lord (the Monk locate level) entirely, as
  well as its flavor text, so that it isn't a duplicate of the Rogue locate
  level.
Replace the Monk upper filler level(s) with a grassy, river-crossed,
  tree-dotted plain instead of room-and-corridor filler.

It contains the following non-gameplay interface changes:

A fair amount of monster letter rearrangement:
  All types of sea monsters are moved from ; to z. No colors are changed.
  The U class is rebranded as "aberrations" (and umber hulks remain in it).
  Quantum mechanics are moved from Q to U, and remain cyan.
  Mind flayers and master mind flayers are moved from h to U. They are
    recolored from their cyan/bright cyan to magenta/bright magenta.
  All types of elves are moved from @ to Q (for Quendi). No colors are changed.

It contains the following non-gameplay architectural changes:
TREEs can now be specified in des files, which obviously produces a tree.
Grass can now be specified in des files (as g or ,), which produces grass.
  Either of these characters can also be used in things like INIT_MAP to create
  a mines-style filler level but with a grassy plain.
