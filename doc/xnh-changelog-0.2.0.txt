xNetHack 0.2.0 Changelog

This is the first minor update version of xNetHack. It is a fork off of
the vanilla NetHack 3.6.1 release, and is also based directly on
xNetHack 0.1.0. It will continue to contain all of the latest commits
pushed by the vanilla devteam; see doc/fixes36.1 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, it might be out of date; in case of conflicting
information, this changelog and others in this folder are more up-to-date than
the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.6.1, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 0.2.0 contains the following
gameplay changes:

The object materials patch has been ported (mostly from GruntHack):
  Objects may now generate being made of a material that isn't their base type.
  This affects their weight, price, AC (for armor), and special effects, such
    as silver affecting demons.
  Special-material variants of objects such as silver daggers have been removed.
    Some names are changed to reflect this (e.g. leather armor is now "light
    armor", iron skull cap is now "skull cap")
  Artifacts always have one specific material. This is the same as the base
    item for all artifacts except for Sunsword (gold), Werebane (silver),
    Grayswandir (silver), and the Platinum Yendorian Express Card (platinum).
  Materials are not wishable except in wizard mode.
  Items in the hero's initial inventory are always their standard material.
  Golems can drop items made of their material in addition to their standard
    drops.
  Glass items always break when thrown, and glass weapons break 1/6 of the time
    when used in melee. Glass armor, if it is randomly targeted by an attack,
    will break 1/6 of the time.
  Erodeproofing glass items by any of the normal methods shatterproofs it. This
    can also be wished for.
  Hobbits' elven chain mails are always mithril.
  Weapons may get damage bonuses or penalties based on their material; for
    instance, sharp glass weapons do +3 damage, and gold blunt weapons do +2
    damage.
Nymphs and foocubi will introduce themselves (giving them a name) if they do
  not already have a name, when they initiate their charm or seduction attacks.
Permanent hallucination mode: enable it with OPTIONS=hallucination in config.
  This is unbreakable unless you wield Grayswandir. It is counted as a conduct.
Permanent deafness mode: enable it with OPTIONS=deaf in config. It is counted
  as a conduct.
Throwing a single gold piece upwards makes you flip it and get heads or tails.
Room-and-corridor level rooms have a 2/5 chance to generate items instead of a
  1/3 chance.
Peaceful or tame monsters that are sleeping, paralyzed, or otherwise immobilized
  can never be displaced. Sessile monsters can be displaced 1/6 of the time.
Decrease chance of secret passages generating: they never generate on the first
  four levels; on deeper levels, whenever a secret passage might have been
  generated with its 1% chance, it instead uses a 1 in (level-4 / 2000) chance.
Each barracks in the castle may open into either the courtyard or the throne
  room with equal probability. These doors are no longer locked.
Orcish Town now contains all the gear that the shopkeepers, watchmen, and
  priest would have carried, as well as all the shop loot from the destroyed
  shops, scattered around.

It contains the following non-gameplay interface changes:

Lots of new hallucinatory monsters, engravings, shirts, headstones, and rumors.
Add the curses interface (OPTIONS=windowtype:curses). And there was much
  rejoicing.
A message is always printed when monsters are created.
A message is always printed when the hero teleports.

It contains the following non-gameplay architectural changes:

Refactor xlogfile bitfields. Blind and nudist are moved to conducts. The exact
  number of bones files generated now has a whole byte to itself, in the flags
  field.
Add whereis patch. Every time the hero changes levels, a whereis file is
  updated with some information about them.
Refactor create_critters() and bagotricks() logic so that the latter can call
  the former.
Add a new monster status "dead" to the level parser, which makes the monster
  instantly die (without a message or any in-game effect) when the level is
  loaded. The point is so that special levels can generate realistic items that
  the monster would have been carrying without having to specify and
  reimplement the logic for that.
