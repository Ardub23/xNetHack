xNetHack 0.5.0 Changelog

This is a minor version of xNetHack. It is a fork off of the vanilla NetHack
3.6.2 development version release, and is also based directly on xNetHack 0.4.1.
It will continue to contain all of the latest commits pushed by the vanilla
devteam on their 3.6.2 branch; see doc/fixes36.2 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, the wiki page might be out of date; in case of
conflicting rnformation, this changelog and others in this directory are more
up-to-date than the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than
this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.6.1, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 0.4.0 contains the following
gameplay changes:

You can sometimes recover from food poisoning with a Con/100 chance.
If you have hungerless casting, you will never be too hungry to cast a spell.
Corpses dropped by zombies can revive on their own.
When you are killed by a zombie, you will arise from the grave as one in bones
  (25% chance to keep playing as a zombie, similar to other undead).
When a zombie or lich kills a monster that has a zombie counterpart in melee, it
  resurrects as a zombie that is either tame or hostile depending on the
  attacking zombie.
Zombies will grudge monsters that they can zombify, and vice versa.
The pet-off-level-untaming timer is fuzzed so it's not totally predictable.
Pets' willingness to attack foes of a certain level decreases linearly with
  their hit point percentage.
Trees can generate in the rooms of room-and-corridor levels.
Elven items use their base material 60% of the time and become wood 20% of the
  time rather than defaulting to wood 80% of the time.

It contains the following non-gameplay interface changes:

Potion bottles are called by nonsensical names when hallucinating.
Your god will belch, bray, squeak, and so on instead of booming or thundering
  while you are hallucinating.
Confused scrolls of fire underwater evaporate the water like a regular scroll.
A message is printed when you fail to walk into liquid, and the first time this
  happens in the game it informs you that you can use m to walk in.
Add a new paranoid confirmation option "throw"; when on, it prompts for
  confirmation when you try to throw ammo with no matching launcher for it.
Dwarves think all rats are delicious.


It contains the following non-gameplay architectural changes:

Refactor spell hunger reduction logic into its own function.
Refactor confusing logic of what food adjective to choose.
Change all obj->material = foo statements into a function set_material which
  handles weight recalculation and erosion differences between the materials.
