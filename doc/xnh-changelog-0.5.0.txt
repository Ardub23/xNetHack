xNetHack 0.5.0 Changelog

This is a minor version of xNetHack. It is a fork off of the vanilla NetHack
3.6.2 development version release, and is also based directly on xNetHack 0.4.1.
It will continue to contain all of the latest commits pushed by the vanilla
devteam on their 3.6.2 branch; see doc/fixes36.2 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, the wiki page might be out of date; in case of
conflicting rnformation, this changelog and others in this directory are more
up-to-date than the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than
this changelog.

made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 0.4.0 contains the following
