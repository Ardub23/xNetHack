xNetHack 6.0 Changelog

This is a major version of xNetHack. It is based directly on xNetHack 5.1, and
is a fork off the vanilla NetHack 3.7.0 development version release. See
doc/fixes37.0 for the devteam's changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, the wiki page might be out of date; in case of
conflicting information, this changelog and others in this directory are more
up-to-date than the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than
this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.7, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 6.0 contains the following
gameplay changes:

The geyser spell will rust armor and instakill you if you are an iron golem.
Vault guards grudge leprechauns.
Vampires grudge werewolves and vice versa.
Potions of acid no longer freeze when hit with cold damage.
All nymphs are now herbivorous (mainly meaning that pet nymphs will eat veggy
  food and polymorphing into one does not make you inediate).
Salamanders, all Kops, and all corpse-leaving i-class monsters (imps, tengu,
  quasits, homunculi, and leprechauns) are now carnivorous. This mainly means
  that they are capable of eating meat when tamed and prefer it over veggy
  food, and polymorphing into one does not make you inediate.
Ghosts cannot be renamed.
Reading a scroll of identify while confused will "identify yourself" and give
  enlightenment.
Port L's Cursed Wand Backfire Patch: zapping a cursed directional wand will
  cause it to backfire and zap you 10% of the time. This is independent of the
  1% chance that a cursed wand will blow up upon use.
Martial arts users, sasquatches, and players wearing kicking boots can no
  longer miss a monster completely with a clumsy kick.
Statues hit by a wand of opening will drop their contents without breaking.
Watch captains generate with a key.
The Gnomish Sewer now contains a couple figurines of jellies.


It contains the following non-gameplay interface changes:

Light armor, studded armor, jackets, plain cloaks, and identified plain gloves
  will display their default leather material when made out of leather.


It contains the following non-gameplay architectural changes:

tipcontainer() is generalized to work for spilling objects out of a container
  on some space other than the player' other than the player's.
