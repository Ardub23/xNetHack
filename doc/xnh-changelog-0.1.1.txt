xNetHack 0.1.1 Changelog

This is the first minor update version of xNetHack. It remains a fork off of
the vanilla NetHack 3.6.1 development version, and is also based directly on
xNetHack 0.1.0. It will continue to contain most or all of the latest commits
pushed by the vanilla devteam; see doc/fixes36.1 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, it might be out of date; in case of conflicting
information, this changelog and others in this folder are more up-to-date than
the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than this changelog.

made in xNetHack 0.1.0, xNetHack 0.1.1 contains the following gameplay changes:
