xNetHack 0.1.1 Changelog

This is the first minor update version of xNetHack. It remains a fork off of
the vanilla NetHack 3.6.1 development version, and is also based directly on
xNetHack 0.1.0. It will continue to contain all of the latest commits
pushed by the vanilla devteam; see doc/fixes36.1 for these changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, it might be out of date; in case of conflicting
information, this changelog and others in this folder are more up-to-date than
the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.6.1, and any changes
made in xNetHack 0.1.0, xNetHack 0.1.1 contains the following gameplay changes:

Change the level generation of maze levels (mostly Gehennom, but also applies to mazes below Medusa) rather drastically. Widemazes and corridor mazes are currently disabled. Instead, several rooms are generated and placed before the maze generates, and aligned with it. These rooms can be walless, leaving large swaths of the level open, or they can be new Gehennom-themed special rooms. The new special rooms include:
* Demon dens, containing demons and simple piles of loot.
* Submerged rooms, containing sea monsters and a sunken treasure chest.
* Lava rooms, containing salamanders.
* Slaughterhouses, bloody rooms containing corpses, leashes, and knives.
* Seminaries of Moloch, a regular temple to Moloch containing one peaceful priest and several hostile priests.
Maze levels above the Castle will use regular Dungeons special rooms instead of these.
New conduct unfair-scare-less, which tracks the number of times you scare monsters while standing on a position of impunity, such as an Elbereth square or scroll of scare monster.
Monsters that deliberately jump into polymorph traps will stay in-depth.
Foocubi no longer affect maximum Pw; the effects now only either set current Pw to max or 0.
Spellcasting system tweaked: skill no longer gives you a bonus, but caps your effective success rate instead
Boost most roles' starting Pw amounts so that in general casters starting with level 1 spells will be able to cast them.
Rings of carrying now produce a unique message when dropped into sinks.
You can force-fight a web with a bladed weapon to attempt to cut through and destroy it. Chance of success depends on Str.
Wielding Sting will auto-destroy any web you are stuck in when you try to move out of it, also letting you take your move normally.
Dropping a container onto an altar will show colored flashes corresponding to its contents and identify their beatitude.
Objects will merge with other objects even if the enchantment, beatitude, or erosionproofing on one of the items is not known. The merge will retain your knowledge of the objects' enchantment and beatitude.
