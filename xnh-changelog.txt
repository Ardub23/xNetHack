xNetHack 0.1.0 Changelog
Last Updated: commit d6017c53b5294322ad2bb1e3a76fcabcf205eef8

This is the first version of xNetHack, forked off the NetHack 3.6.1
development version. It will continue to contain most or all of the latest
commits pushed by the vanilla devteam; see doc/fixes36.1 for these changes.
On top of these, xNetHack 0.1.0 contains the following gameplay changes:

Add "artifactless" conduct: never touch an artifact (14th bit of xlogfile conduct)
Add "petless" conduct: zero tame monsters the whole game (13th bit of xlogfile conduct)
Change magic traps' taming effect to pacification
Bribing demons demand 50d500 gold, regardless of what the hero is carrying, and may be successfully shortchanged depending on the hero's Charisma
Exploding bag of holding scatters 12/13 of its contents instead of destroying them outright
Generate a lot more monsters when a level is created, and slow down the normal generation rates
Add a barricaded shop with an alive shopkeeper to Orcish Town, and scatter around a lot of gear that should be dropped by the dead denizens
Drop the XL threshold for the Quest to 10
Wielding a mirror confers a 50% chance of reflecting any reflectable attack
Add the Gnomish Sewer Mines' End (dark twisty water level with many rings)
Remove random chance of extra-powerful poison (instadeath in vanilla) from all poison sources
Scroll of light now gives 11 radius when uncursed and lights up the entire level when blessed
Scroll of teleport now gives a controlled teleport when blessed
Make scroll of remove curse type-IDed when one successfully changes the beatitude of items in inventory.
Green slimes have an engulfing attack that starts sliming
Candle light radius is now sqrt(x)+1 instead of log_7(x)+1
Non-spiked pits occasionally generate in graveyards, and they are flavored as open graves
Remove the mysterious force
Blessed scroll of destroy armor asks the player which piece of armor to destroy
You can rub rocks together or on touchstones to break them, occasionally producing flint stones
Flint stones' weight is reduced to 1 aum
Orc-captains are considered a lord to their kind, and their speed is increased from 5 to 9.
The wand of speed monster on the player gives temporary very fast speed but not intrinsic speed
The potion of speed gives intrinsic speed and a short duration of very fast speed
Remove spell failure; instead, Pw cost is divided by what the success rate would have been
Wielding a spellbook cuts the Pw cost of casting its spell in half
The amulet of life saving does not work if the player is polymorphed into a nonliving form
Occasionally when you die to vampires, green slimes, mummies, or anything else that would have made you arise from the grave, you turn into that monster but retain your sanity, and continue playing with permanent intrinsic unchanging.
The player can now displace peaceful monsters (with a few small exceptions: Oracle, shopkeepers, priests, quest leader)
Add thiefstones, a gray stone which steals magic items and treasure back to a location on the level it generates. If the player tracks it down and removes its curse, they can use it to their own benefit.
Unicorn horn is a poorer weapon (1d8/1d10), and no longer restores lost ability points, but is made one-handed and applies itself passively if wielded in the bare main hand.
Potions may be #dipped in sinks to pour them down the drain, causing the hero to suffer its vapor effects.
Add vapor effects for all potions, and make most of them unambiguously identify the potion
Rebalance spellbook failure effects; notably a failure causes confusion instead of paralysis, and paralysis only happens as a side effect of level 5+ books. The steal gold effect is also replaced with the book biting you. A new level 1+ effect is the book dropping one level in BUC.
Spellbooks disintegrate if and only if they are already cursed
Blessed and cursed spellbooks act as +/- 10 Int, instead of guaranteeing success and failure
Ghosts of Dudley can now be encountered
Magic lamps can be wished for
Throw out the complicated spellbook delay formula; all spellbook delays are now 10*level
Chargeable rings will never generate at +0
"Klunk!" from kicking a sink is less likely
"Flupp!" effect from kicking a sink will dislodge and spit up one ring buried under the sink
All sinks on non-special levels now generate with one ring buried beneath them
Dropping a ring down a sink has an 80% chance of being buried beneath it, rather than 20%
Confused scroll of light will conjure several tame cancelled lights, which cannot explode but are useful as a light source. Will be yellow lights if non-cursed and black lights if cursed.
Treasure zoos generate only animal monsters
Wielding a quarterstaff or wand of nothing reduces the Pw cost of a spell just like a robe would do, and not stacking with it. Wielding a wand that corresponds to a certain spell (e.g. wand of death for the finger of death spell) does the same thing, but for that spell only.
All roles now have a standardized "cutoff level" of 12 for maxHP and maxPw gains.
Scrolls of identify always identify 7/4/1 items for B/U/C; full inventory ID is no longer possible from scroll
Throne insight always gives a full inventory identify
Spell of identify is removed
Replace the KABOOM!! door trap with several different interesting traps that scale with dungeon level: screeching hinges, self-locking mechanisms, statically charged doorknob, falling bucket of water, removed hinges, boulder dropping out of the ceiling, hot doorknob, and fiery explosion.
Hitting a gremlin with light will anger it
Add ring of carrying: chargeable 200zm ring that increases or decreases carrying capacity by 5% per enchantment.
Change can of grease material to plastic and color it bright blue
Change hexagonal wand material to quartz (gemstone)
Potions of oil cannot be diluted
Uncursed food no longer gives "Blecch! Rotten food!"; cram and lembas never do even when cursed
Spellbooks of cure blindness, invisibility, and detect food no longer randomly generate (can still be wished for or written)
Change some spell levels:
* Dig: 5 -> 3
* Detect monsters: 1 -> 3
* Clairvoyance: 3 -> 2
* Charm monster: 3 -> 6
* Detect unseen: 3 -> 2
* Turn undead: 6 -> 2
* Jumping: 1 -> 2
Dwarvish and Uruk-hai shields count as bulky
Replace old spell formula with a more straightforward one; see the cc554357 commit message for details.
Upper Mines levels are always lit; Lower Mines levels are always dark.
Use a new, more continuous, Pw regeneration formula from FIQHack (see commit 56c5bbbb)
Wizards get four spellbooks in starting inventory (force bolt, magic missile, and two random). This replaces the scrolls, potions, rings and wand they previously started with.
Shriekers will spawn a baby purple worm if regular purple worms are too hard
Scalpels do 1d5 damage versus small and 1d7 versus large monsters.
Land mine weight is reduced to 40; beartrap weight is reduced to 50.
Rangers start the game with two beartraps.
1/40 of random non-artifact weapons generate erodeproof.
The player does not trigger rolling boulder traps unless on the ground.

It contains the following non-gameplay interface changes:

Using the open command to target "." (self) is an alias for #loot
When you ascend with a non-starting alignment, the end-of-game reason is "ascended (in dishonor)".

Sinks render as blue \, drawbridges as orange +

Whenever monsters polymorph in sight of the hero, print a message saying what they turned into

Priests will give you bitcoins for an ale while hallucinating
After being crowned, thrones give you the "very comfortable here" message
Paying exactly 1/10 of your gold to a priest will "pay your tithe"
Port monster lookup from FIQHack: when you are looking up a specific monster in the encyclopedia, a full description of its stats, abilities, and attacks will be shown above the encyclopedia entry
The Candelabrum reads (n/7 candles attached) to make explicit that it holds 7 candles
Gravestone color is now white; this probably doesn't matter for a lot of fonts
Implement object lookup: when you are looking up a specific object in the encyclopedia, a full description of its stats and other properties will be shown above the encyclopedia entry
Bones levels now have a level sound: the same "eerie feeling" as in walking into an abandoned temple

It is now impossible to enter water or lava unless you are impaired, know you are safe, or use the 'm' command.
Add "swim" to the list of paranoid_confirmation options. When enabled, you will be prompted before unsafely entering water when you try to move there with the 'm' command.
Add "trap" to the list of paranoid_confirmation options, and always prompt before stepping onto a trap, unless impaired, or unless the player is obviously immune to the trap's effects.
Merge FIQ's getobj patch: more developer-customizable prompts for objects, and these prompts also accept , representing "object or dungeon feature on the floor".
Water walking boots self-identify if they obviously prevent you from entering water. If they prevent you from entering lava, their fireproofness is also identified.

It contains the following non-gameplay architectural changes:

Priest quest and Castle use FLAGS:graveyard instead of hardcoding in source
Object probabilities no longer have to add up to 1000 for each object class
Add two new coordinates to struct obj (to allow thiefstones to migrate to a certain spot)
Touchstones are no longer a magical item
Valley entrance message is moved into gehennom.des instead of hardcoding
Move most paralysis sources into a new make_paralyzed function
Refactor testing for whether an object has a specific randomized description into a new function objdescr_is()
Rename cost() to ink_cost()
Remove enermod() function since it was only being called in one place
Comprehensive doors overhaul: "locked" and "trapped" are no longer separate states, but simply flags; actual state of a door (none, broken, open, closed) are reduced to 2 bits, freeing up one bit for later use.
The b_trapped and mb_trapped are removed; the new door traps make them unused.
Import livelogging, dgamelaunch simplemail, and dgamelaunch extrainfo.
impossible() now asks the player to report the message to the developer.
Add immune_to_trap() function which works symmetrically on monsters and players. Currently used only in conjunction with paranoid trap mechanics, but intended to be used for monster AI in the future.
Merge a lot of (is_floater() || is_flyer() || is_clinger()) logic into a new !grounded() macro, which cleans up some edge cases that weren't previously covered.
